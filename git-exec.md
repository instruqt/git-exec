# Git-Exec Library - Remaining Work

## Overview

This document tracks remaining unimplemented features and enhancements for the git-exec library. Most core functionality is complete and documented in [README.md](README.md).

## Not Yet Implemented

### Bare Repository Support

The library needs specific handling for bare repository operations:

- **Bare Repository Detection**: Automatically detect when working with bare repositories
- **Reference Management**: Direct manipulation of refs without working directory
- **Bare Clone Operations**: Enhanced support for `--bare` clone operations
- **Server-side Operations**: Operations typically performed on Git servers

### Command Enhancements

The following commands have basic implementations but could be enhanced:


#### Advanced Commands
- **Revert**: Enhanced revert operations with conflict handling
- **Reflog**: Structured parsing of reflog entries
- **Remove**: Enhanced file removal with better error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Authentication
- **Credential Helper Integration**: Support for Git credential helpers
- **SSH Key Support**: Direct SSH key authentication
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh mechanisms

### Performance
- **Command Batching**: Batch multiple operations for efficiency
- **Output Streaming**: Stream output for large operations
- **Parallel Operations**: Concurrent operation support where safe

### Advanced Git Features
- **Stash Operations**: Complete stash management
- **Bisect Support**: Automated bisecting workflows
- **Archive Creation**: Git archive operations
- **Bundle Operations**: Git bundle creation and extraction
- **Worktree Support**: Multiple working tree management

### Developer Experience
- **Progress Callbacks**: Progress reporting for long operations
- **Custom Merge Strategies**: Support for custom merge strategies
- **Hook Management**: Git hook installation and management
- **Interactive Operations**: Support for interactive rebasing, adding, etc.

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority
1. **Bare Repository Support** - Critical for server-side Git operations

### Medium Priority
1. **Advanced Authentication** - Credential helper integration
2. **Performance Optimizations** - Command batching and streaming
3. **Stash Operations** - Common developer workflow

### Low Priority
1. **Archive/Bundle Operations** - Specialized use cases
2. **Interactive Operations** - Complex UI interactions
3. **Custom Strategies** - Advanced Git workflows

## Contributing

When implementing these features:
- Follow the existing functional options pattern
- Add comprehensive tests with good coverage
- Update both this document and README.md
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Follow Go best practices for error handling
